# Combos

Combos finds all combinations of the letters in a given word.

Issues:

1. Combos does not currently work for words longer than five letters. This
may have been the result on my Raspberry Pi, but further investigation is needed.

2. Combos does not currently accept words with repeated letters.

Compile with:

```
javac Comb.java
```

Use with:
```
java Comb <word>
```
